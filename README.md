# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset to predict whether a person has diabetes based on health-related features.

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for EDA
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, StandardScaler)
- K-Means Clustering for patient segmentation

## Steps Covered:
- Data Cleaning (replacing zeros, handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (histograms, boxplots, heatmap)
- Feature Scaling and Outlier Removal
- Model Building using Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Clustering for risk segmentation

## Accuracy Achieved:
- Logistic Regression: ~78%

## Dataset:
Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle/UCI)
